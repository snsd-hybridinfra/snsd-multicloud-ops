# AWS Network Validation Environment Placeholder

This directory demonstrates how the local `aws-network` module may be wired with non-production example values.

## Review Workflow

1. Review `terraform.tfvars.example`; do not copy real values into the repository.
2. Run the repository validator from retired-numbered-case.
3. If Terraform is installed, the validator may run `terraform fmt -check` only.

## Safety Boundary

- No AWS provider or remote backend is configured.
- No real `terraform.tfvars`, tfstate, lock file, credentials, or account identifiers are stored.
- retired-numbered-case does not execute `terraform init`, `validate`, `plan`, `apply`, or `destroy` because provider initialization is outside this scenario.
- AWS authentication and resource creation are not part of this environment.
