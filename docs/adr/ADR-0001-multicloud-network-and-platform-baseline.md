# ADR-0001: Multi-Cloud Network and Platform Baseline

- Status: ACCEPTED (EVE-NG and one OpenStack AIO network path partially implement the baseline)
- Date: 2026-07-15
- Decision Type: Architecture and planning normalization
- Implementation Effect: None by itself

## Context

The repository had a minimum local-lab reference, but it did not provide one
authoritative phase order or explicit responsibility, CIDR, cost, lifecycle, and
external-exposure boundaries for EVE-NG, OpenStack, AWS, Azure, local Kubernetes,
and local MariaDB.

Some valid evidence was already collected on a flat Bootstrap Management
Network. That evidence must be retained without being mistaken for completed
service-zone migration.

## Decision

1. EVE-NG is the On-Prem network-control axis.
2. OpenStack is the Private Cloud axis.
3. AWS and Azure are minimum, cost-bounded public-cloud validation environments.
4. Local Kubernetes is the application runtime.
5. Local MariaDB is the internal primary/replica data platform.
6. External exposure is optional and limited to HTTP/HTTPS.
7. Planned aggregates are `10.10.0.0/16` (On-Prem), `10.20.0.0/16`
   (OpenStack), `10.30.0.0/16` (AWS), `10.40.0.0/16` (Azure), and optional
   `10.255.0.0/16` (WireGuard).
8. The OpenStack provider/external CIDR must be discovered from the lab rather
   than invented. The S005 run established the approved VLAN 70 provider
   subnet while dynamic router and Floating IP values remain masked.
9. Actual bootstrap runtime CIDR/host addresses and the external address remain
   masked under repository policy.
10. Infrastructure follows Plan, Apply, Validate, sanitized evidence, Destroy,
    and cleanup verification.

## Alternatives Considered

- Use AWS/Azure as full application platforms: rejected for cost and scope.
- Make OpenStack optional: rejected because Private Cloud is a core platform
  axis.
- Replace existing bootstrap evidence after migration: rejected because evidence
  remains valid for the observed bootstrap state.
- Require WireGuard: rejected; connectivity method remains optional.
- Commit actual bootstrap addresses: rejected by repository sensitive-data rules.

## Consequences

- One canonical Lab Phase 0-10 sequence is maintained in
  `docs/lab-build-order.md`.
- AWS/Azure resource counts and prohibited services are explicit.
- Planned CIDRs are non-overlapping, while bootstrap/provider conflicts remain
  explicit local/discovery checks.
- S008, S017, S023, S024, and S025 are planned for network-path revalidation
  after service-zone migration.
- S021/S022 are not repeated solely for renumbering unless runtime configuration
  changes.
- No scenario status changes merely because this ADR is accepted; S002 and
  S005 advance only through their separate evidence packages.

## Validation and Review

Review the architecture documents for internal consistency, run repository
validators, and repeat CIDR conflict checks before any apply. This ADR remains
a decision record, not implementation evidence; runtime evidence is held by
S002 and S005.

## Non-Production Disclaimer

The decision governs a disposable portfolio lab and does not authorize cloud
spend, public exposure, production deployment, or compliance claims.
